  This is my first post on the Grid and I am excited to get started with this
  AI-based website creation app. I joined the Grid a loooong time ago and it
  took them a loooooooooong time to grant me access to the beta. They said that
  they were struggling hard with building it which seems understandable. On the
  other hand, though, they were making bold promises from the start.

A lot of projects are late, I get that. Especially big IT projects get bogged down in feature creep amongst other things. This one, the Grid, might be different. I tend to think of it more in terms of Elbphilharmonie in Hamburg then the new Berlin airport. Both have been delayed, the cost of both has increased dramatically over the initial estimates.

There is a significant difference between the two, though. People have been building airports for ages now. Architects, contractors and administrations should know how to build them. It's been done before. Failing as miserably as Berlin and Brandenburg have is just plain ridiculous. On the other hand, a concert hall on top of an old warehouse that sits on stilts in a river with huge amounts of boat traffic has never been done before. Elbphilharmonie is a genuine architectural invention.

I can live with it being a little late and being a little more expensive then planned. Unfortunately, it was a lot more expensive and late for a lot. I just hope that, when it opens next year, it will be as breathtaking as it is made out to be.

Let us hope the same for the Grid.
